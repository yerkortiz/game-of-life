# Conway's Game of Life
The implementation is written in python3, is a grid of n x m cells where every cell has two possible states, life or dead. The state changes are given from the existence of the next rule: if a dead cell has two or three live cells in it Moore neighborhood then this cell will come back to life, but if a cell has more than 3 or less than two live cells in it Moore neighborhood then this cell will die by overpopulation or loneliness.
